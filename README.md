# STLWRT

For anyone who does not know yet, STLWRT is *the* successor to GTK+ 2,
originally based almost entirely on the original code from GTK+ 2.  STLWRT
has deviated from the GTK+ 2 code, however, and continues to deviate.
Ultimately, the goal is to be able to run most GTK+ 2 and many GTK+ 3
applications using the same STLWRT library, while both types of applications
keep a conservative, traditional GTK+ 2-esque look and feel.

I emphasized the word "the" above because, as of right now, I do not know of
anyone else who has any actively maintained fork of any version of GTK.
If anyone who has such a fork happens to be reading this, please drop me
a line and let me know; I'd be interested in the design decisions you are
making and have made, and I hope we may be able to collaborate somehow.

## This repository has been temporarily suspended!

Due to a slew of reasons, including personal issues that indirectly involve
current events, I cannot commit any more time to open-source in the near
term.  I am sorry to say this, but therefore, development of this project
has stalled and will remain stalled likely for a few more months.

I also believe that when I return to this project, I should probably go
about it in a totally different way.  I might even have to rebase STLWRT
off of GTK+ 2.32.32 or 2.32.33 all over again.  If that is the case, then
this repository will be permanently suspended, and I will then begin
working on STLWRT-ng or whatever it may be named.  However, that does not
mean that that is the definite fate of STLWRT.

**Do not keep posing issues about how to compile STLWRT; I will not respond
to them anymore, at least in this repository.**
